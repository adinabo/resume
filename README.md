# Resume Mini Project

The scope of this mini-project is for me to practice HTML, CSS and Bootstrap by building my Locum Dental Nurse resume, that allows dental practices to view my work history and in the future scroll through my availability and book me.

## Project Overview

It contains information from my personal CV such as: personal details, work experience, education, etc.

## Features

Responsive Design using Bootstrap
Custom styling with CSS

Structure:
This project will be composed of
3 pages:to avoid cognitive overload: - index.html - resume.html - contact.html

All 3 pages contain the same structure and similar styles, to keep it consistent, intuitive and easy to navigate.
We use a combination of colors, icons and text tp help the users differentiate navigational elements.
The users also have a download button to make it easier to download.

## Features To Be Added

Features to be added in the future:
QR code which will take the users straight to the webpage
A calendar with my availability, where the user can select the day and book. The user will be taken to a form where they will insert the dental practice address, schedule with the number of hours they would like to book and once they confirm, they will be taken to a separate page where they will make the payment.
The user will get a confirmation message and an email to confirm that the locum dental nuse has been booked and some contact information.
A Terms and Condition link will be added in the footer once all the above is done.
